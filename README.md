# Bathroom Finder  

Our app will help users find the best bathroom on the UCSB campus, ensuring they have a comfortable and pleasant experience while navigating the facilities. With ratings, user reviews, and location-based features, we aim to make restroom finding easier and more efficient for everyone. This app is developed on an iOS platform. There will be two types of users, users and admins. Users can post about bathrooms, review and comment on them as they wish. Admins will manage the posts that the users make to ensure that only the appropriate ones are present.
