Meeting (Week 2):
- Finalized tech stack: Swift, Firebase, and Google Maps API.
- Assigned roles for issues:

Meeting (Week 2):
- Introduced daily Slack updates to track progress and blockers.
- Decided to stop unnecessary GitHub repo reorganization and focus on functionality.

Meeting (Week 3):
- make authenification work
- Voted on adding features upload functionality (currently in progress).

Meeting (Week 4):
- make map work and location work
- make review work
- Voted on adding features upload functionality (currently in progress).

Meeting (Week 5):
- make backend to store information

### User Experience (UX) Considerations
Task/User Flow

User Flow for Finding a Bathroom:
- Login: Users authenticate via Firebase.
- Search: Navigate to the search page to find bathrooms by name, location, or rating.
- Details: Tap on a bathroom marker or search result to view details (ratings, reviews, photos).
- Post Review: Users can leave reviews or rate their experience.

UX Design Goals
- Simplicity: Minimalist interface with clear navigation for both users and admins.
- Responsiveness: Optimize layouts for different screen sizes
- Intuitiveness: Provide clear feedback for user actions

Future Enhancements
- Add photo upload capability for bathrooms and reviews.
- Integrate filters for search results (e.g., cleanliness, accessibility).
