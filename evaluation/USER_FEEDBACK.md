## User Preference for Bathroom Rating Criteria

What to Test: Determine which criteria are most important for users when rating bathrooms. For example, cleanliness, availability of amenities (e.g., soap, paper towels), accessibility, or overall comfort.\
Why: Understanding user priorities will help refine the rating system and ensure it reflects what users care about most.\
How: Conduct a survey or usability test where users rank their preferred rating factors or suggest new ones.
## Effectiveness of Location-Based Search

What to Test: Evaluate how users experience the location-based search feature, particularly whether the results are relevant and accurate based on their proximity.\
Why: Accurate and intuitive search results are crucial for user satisfaction, as the app's primary goal is to help users find nearby bathrooms.\
How: Set up a study where users simulate searching for bathrooms from different campus locations and gather feedback on the search functionality.\
## User Satisfaction with Post Moderation

What to Test: Assess whether users feel the app strikes the right balance between allowing open feedback and ensuring reviews are appropriate.\
Why: Effective moderation improves trust in the platform but must avoid being overly restrictive, which could discourage users from contributing.\
How: Gather feedback through a mix of surveys and interviews about their posting and reviewing experience, focusing on whether they feel their contributions are respected and valued.
