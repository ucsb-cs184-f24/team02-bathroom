# Design Document: Bathroom Finder

## Project Overview
The Bathroom Finder app is designed to assist users in finding the best bathrooms on the UCSB campus, ensuring a comfortable and efficient experience. The app leverages user ratings, reviews, and location-based features to provide personalized and relevant restroom suggestions. This iOS-based app is designed with two user roles: Users and Admins. Users can search, rate, and review bathrooms, while Admins moderate content to maintain a clean and respectful platform.
