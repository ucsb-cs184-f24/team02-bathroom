# User Feedback Ideas

## First Idea: Enhancing Map Navigation and Visualization
Feedback Summary: Users struggled with navigating to bathrooms using the current map interface. They found it challenging to locate bathrooms, especially when multiple restrooms are within the same building.

Proposed Improvements:

Improved Map Abilities: Enhance the map's functionality to provide more intuitive navigation. This includes zooming features, clearer path indicators, and better integration with campus landmarks.

Clearer Markers: Add distinct and easily recognizable markers for each bathroom location. Differentiate markers for various types of restrooms (e.g., gender-specific, accessible) to aid quick identification.Potentially also group bathrooms in the same building into a folder of sort. Kind of like a iphone app folder

Bathroom Entrance Photos: Incorporate photos of each bathroom entrance within the app. This visual aid helps users recognize the correct building and restroom entrance, reducing confusion and saving time.

## Second Idea: Expanding the Rating System
Feedback Summary: Users wanted more detailed rating options beyond the existing 5-star scale. They expressed interest in evaluating specific aspects of the bathrooms to provide more comprehensive feedback.

Proposed Improvements:

Additional Rating Criteria: Introduce sub-ratings for cleanliness, accessibility, and occupancy levels. This allows users to provide detailed feedback on different facets of each bathroom.
Cleanliness: Rate the overall cleanliness of the facility.

Accessibility: Evaluate how accessible the bathroom is for individuals with disabilities.

Occupancy Levels: Indicate how frequently the bathroom is occupied or crowded.


## Third Idea: Enabling Photo Submissions in Reviews

Feedback Summary: Users indicated a need for the ability to upload photos when submitting reviews. Visual content can provide more context and help other users make informed decisions.

Proposed Improvements:

Photo Upload Feature: Allow users to attach photos to their reviews. This feature enables users to showcase the actual condition and features of the bathroom, such as cleanliness, signage, and facilities.

Review Moderation: Implement a moderation system to ensure that uploaded photos adhere to community guidelines and maintain the appâ€™s quality standards. Add a bluring feature where users can unblur.

Next Steps
Based on the feedback received from these user feedback ideas, we will prioritize and implement the necessary improvements to enhance the  Bathroom Finder app. Continuous user engagement and feedback will remain important to the app's iterative development process, ensuring it evolves to meet the needs of its diverse user base effectively.
