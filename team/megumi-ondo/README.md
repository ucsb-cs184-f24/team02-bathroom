# User Evaluation for Bathroom Finder App
## Overview
This document outlines the User Evaluation contribution to the Bathroom Finder app. The app is designed to help users find and review bathrooms on the UCSB campus. This evaluation focuses on understanding how easily users can navigate the bathroom search, review, and rating features. The goal is to identify pain points in user interaction and suggest improvements to enhance the overall user experience.

## Evaluation Goal
The primary aim of this User Evaluation was to gather insights on:\

### Usability: How easily users can navigate the bathroom search and review process.
### Effectiveness: How well the app helps users find and rate bathrooms.
### User Experience: Identifying pain points and areas of improvement in the interaction flow, especially for searching and reviewing.
# Methodology
## Participants
Number of Participants: 3 UCSB iOS app testers 
## Process
Participants were asked to perform a series of tasks:\
Search for a bathroom based on location or rating.\
Rate and leave a review for a bathroom.\
After completing these tasks, participants were asked to provide feedback about their experience directly within the app.
# Evaluation Results
## Bathroom Search Functionality:

The bathroom search feature was functional and allowed users to search by both location and highest rating.\
User Feedback: Some participants felt that while these filters were useful, additional feedback or indicators (such as the number of reviews or a bathroom's cleanliness rating) could enhance decision-making.
## Bathroom Review and Rating:

Users were able to rate and leave reviews for bathrooms without major issues.\
User Feedback: Several users suggested that the process could be improved by introducing clearer guidance on how to submit reviews, such as brief instructions on how to rate the bathroom or a reminder to leave a comment after rating.\
## Overall User Interface:

Most users found the app interface easy to use but some suggested making the buttons and options more prominent to avoid confusion.\
Suggestion: A more intuitive layout with better visual cues for actions like posting reviews and searching for bathrooms.\
## Flaws Identified:
Lack of clear instructions on how to post a review.\
Some users were uncertain about whether their review had been successfully posted or saved.

## Recommendations for Improvement
Based on the feedback gathered from participants, the following improvements are suggested:\

### Enhance Review Submission Process:\

Confirmations: Once a user posts a review, provide a confirmation message or visual indicator to reassure them their review was submitted successfully.
## Bathroom Search Features:

While the current location and rating-based search features work well, users expressed interest in adding a cleanliness rating.


# Overall
## Lessons Learned:
The evaluation uncovered key insights into areas where the app's usability can be improved. Specifically, users appreciate the search and review functionalities but need clearer guidance and better feedback when interacting with the app.

## Next Steps:
Implement the recommended UI improvements to make the review process more intuitive.\
Add additional information to the search results.\
Conduct another round of testing to validate these improvements.\
By incorporating these improvements, we can make the app more user-friendly and ensure a better experience for UCSB students and staff.\
