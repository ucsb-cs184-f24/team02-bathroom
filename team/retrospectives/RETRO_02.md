## Action item
Goal: Use the Kanban board better<br />
Experiment: Daily check-ins on Slack/iMessages about the progress and what issues are updated on the kanban board and which issues need to get done<br />
Measurement: Everyone has a similar understanding as a group and we all understand which issues are done this week and which still need to get done in the future.<br />

## Retro Assessment
We used the Start/Stop/Continue process, and we believe it was quite effective. It allowed us to gain a clearer understanding of what each of the group members were working on and how much progress we were making every week. I think that our experiment did benefit our team in that we now communicate better through the messenger and also have a better understanding of what issues are getting done and which ones still need work. I think that since we don't have many issues every week that the process might get a bit repetitive but so far it is working well.
